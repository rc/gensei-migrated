We assessed the *volume fractions* of objects (in our case red ellipsoids obtained by sensei) V_V(objects,ref) using one of stereological method made on two-dimensional serial sections and _points test_ probe: 

V_V(objects,ref) = V(objects)/V(ref) = \sum_{i=1}^m P_i/P_T,

where objects represents ellipsoids, *V(ref)* is the volume of reference space, in this case the volume of whole stack of serial sections. V(objects) and V(ref) were estimated using the Cavalieri principle according to equation: 

estV(c) =  T a/p \sum_{i=1}^m P_i, 

where c corresponds to the ellipsoids and the reference space, respectively, a/p is the known area associated with each point of the test system, T = 0.140845 $\mu$m is the distance between two subsequent sections and P_i is the number of points landing within the relevant component transect on the i-th section. Because the parameters of test point probe of objects and reference space were similar, the equation V_V(objects,ref) could be simplified to:

V_V(objects,ref) =  \sum_{i=1}^m P_i/P_T,

where P_i was a number of points of randomly translated point grid landing within the object transect on the i-th section, P_T was a number of all points of the test system. 

The examples of point test system and counting the intersections using the module PointGrid of the software Ellipse3D (http://www.ellipse.sk/index.htm, ViDiTo Systems, Ko≈°ice, Slovak Republic) follow.

The color channel serial images obtained by sensei, shown in Fig.1, was changed to gray scale using the software IrfanView (http://irfanview.tuwien.zc.zt, Irfan Skiljan, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria). The software Amira (http://www.tgs.com, TGS Inc., Massachusetts, USA) was then used for the three-dimensional reconstruction. The stack of the grey-scale images was loaded in the Amira and the threshold of objects was determined by using histogram curves and the slices were then joined together. The resultant non-smoothing model of individual objects is shown in following figure.
