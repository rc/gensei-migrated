We assessed the *volume fractions* of objects (in our case red ellipsoids obtained by *sensei*) _V_V(objects,ref)_ using one of the *stereological methods* made on two-dimensional serial sections and points test probe: 

_V_V(objects,ref) = V(objects)/V(ref) = \sum_{i=1}^m P_i/P_T_,

where objects represents ellipsoids, _V(ref)_ is the volume of reference space, in this case the volume of whole stack of serial sections. _V(objects)_ and _V(ref)_ were estimated using the Cavalieri principle according to equation: 

_estV(c) =  T a/p \sum_{i=1}^m P_i_, 

where _c_ corresponds to the ellipsoids and the reference space, respectively, _a/p_ is the known area associated with each point of the test system, _T = 0.140845_ $\mu$m is the distance between two subsequent sections and _P_i_ is the number of points landing within the relevant component transect on the _i_-th section. Because the parameters of test point probe of objects and reference space were similar, the equation _V_V(objects,ref)_ could be simplified to:

_V_V(objects,ref) =  \sum_{i=1}^m P_i/P_T_,

where _P_i_ was a number of points of randomly translated point grid landing within the object transect on the _i_-th section, _P_T_ was a number of all points of the test system. 

The examples of point test system and counting the intersections using the module !PointGrid of the *software Ellipse3D* (http://www.ellipse.sk/index.htm, !ViDiTo Systems, Ko≈°ice, Slovak Republic) follow.

The color channel serial images obtained by *sensei* was changed to gray scale using the *software !IrfanView* (http://www.irfanview.com, Irfan Skiljan, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria). The *software Amira* (http://www.tgs.com, TGS Inc., Massachusetts, USA) was then used for the three-dimensional reconstruction. The stack of the grey-scale images was loaded in the Amira and the threshold of objects was determined by using histogram curves and the slices were then joined together. The resultant non-smoothing model of individual objects is shown in following figure.
